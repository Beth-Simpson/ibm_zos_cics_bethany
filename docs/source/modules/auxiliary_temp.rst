auxiliary_temp -- Create and remove the CICS auxiliary temporary storage data set
=================================================================================

Synopsis
--------

Create and remove the \ `auxiliary temporary storage <https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cics-ts/latest?topic=sets-defining-auxiliary-temporary-storage-data-set>`__\  data set used by a CICSÂ® region.

You can use this module when provisioning or de-provisioning a CICS region.

Use the \ :literal:`state`\  option to specify the intended state for the auxiliary temporary storage data set. For example, \ :literal:`state=initial`\  will create an auxiliary temporary storage data set if it doesn't exist.






Parameters
----------

  space_primary (False, int, 200)
    The size of the primary space allocated to the auxiliary temporary storage data set. Note that this is just the value; the unit is specified with \ :literal:`space\_type`\ .

    This option takes effect only when the auxiliary temporary storage data set is being created. If the data set already exists, the option has no effect.

    The size value of the secondary space allocation for the auxiliary temporary storage data set is 10; the unit is specified with \ :literal:`space\_type`\ .


  space_type (False, str, REC)
    The unit portion of the auxiliary temporary storage data set size. Note that this is just the unit; the value is specified with \ :literal:`space\_primary`\ .

    This option takes effect only when the auxiliary temporary storage data set is being created. If the data set already exists, the option has no effect.

    The size can be specified in megabytes (\ :literal:`M`\ ), kilobytes (\ :literal:`K`\ ), records (\ :literal:`REC`\ ), cylinders (\ :literal:`CYL`\ ), or tracks (\ :literal:`TRK`\ ).


  region_data_sets (True, dict, None)
    The location of the region data sets to be created using a template, for example, \ :literal:`REGIONS.ABCD0001.\<\< data\_set\_name \>\>`\ .

    If you want to use a data set that already exists, ensure that the data set is an auxiliary temporary storage data set.


    template (False, str, None)
      The base location of the region data sets with a template.


    dfhtemp (False, dict, None)
      Overrides the templated location for the auxiliary temporary storage data set.


      dsn (False, str, None)
        The data set name of the auxiliary temporary storage to override the template.




  cics_data_sets (False, dict, None)
    The name of the \ :literal:`SDFHLOAD`\  library of the CICS installation, for example, \ :literal:`CICSTS61.CICS.SDFHLOAD`\ .


    template (False, str, None)
      The templated location of the \ :literal:`SDFHLOAD`\  library.


    sdfhload (False, str, None)
      The location of the \ :literal:`SDFHLOAD`\  library to override the template.



  state (True, str, None)
    The intended state for the auxiliary temporary storage data set, which the module will aim to achieve.

    \ :literal:`absent`\  will remove the auxiliary temporary storage data set entirely, if it already exists.

    \ :literal:`initial`\  will create the auxiliary temporary storage data set if it does not already exist.

    \ :literal:`warm`\  will retain an existing auxiliary temporary storage data set in its current state.









Examples
--------

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja

    
    - name: Initialize an auxiliary temporary storage data set
      ibm.ibm_zos_cics.auxiliary_temp:
        region_data_sets:
          template: "REGIONS.ABCD0001.<< data_set_name >>"
        state: "initial"

    - name: Initialize a large auxiliary temporary storage data set
      ibm.ibm_zos_cics.auxiliary_temp:
        region_data_sets:
          template: "REGIONS.ABCD0001.<< data_set_name >>"
        space_primary: 50
        space_type: "M"
        state: "initial"

    - name: Delete an existing auxiliary temporary storage data set
      ibm.ibm_zos_cics.auxiliary_temp:
        region_data_sets:
          template: "REGIONS.ABCD0001.<< data_set_name >>"
        state: "absent"



Return Values

    True if the auxiliary temporary storage data set exists.



end_state (always, dict, )
  The state of the auxiliary temporary storage at the end of the Ansible task.


  vsam (always, bool, )
    True if the data set is a VSAM data set.


  exists (always, bool, )
    True if the auxiliary temporary storage data set exists.



executions (always, list, )
  A list of program executions performed during the Ansible task.


  name (always, str, )
    A human-readable name for the program execution.


  rc (always, int, )
    The return code for the program execution.


  stdout (always, str, )
    The standard out stream returned by the program execution.
