stop_region -- Stop a CICS region
=================================



.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1


Synopsis
--------
- Stop a CICS region by using CEMT PERFORM SHUTDOWN. You can choose to perform a NORMAL or IMMEDIATE shutdown.
- During a NORMAL or IMMEDIATE shutdown, a shutdown assist program should run to enable CICS to shut down in a controlled manner. By default, the CICS-supplied shutdown assist transaction, CESD is used. You can specify a custom shutdown assist program in the SDTRAN system initialization parameter. The task runs until the region has successfully shut down, or until the shutdown fails.
- You must have a console installed in the CICS region so that the stop\_region module can communicate with CICS. To define a console, you must install a terminal with the CONSNAME attribute set to your TSO user ID. For detailed instructions, see \ `Defining TSO users as console devices <https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cics-ts/6.1?topic=cics-defining-tso-users-as-console-devices>`__\ . Add your console definition into one of the resource lists defined on the GRPLIST system initialization parameter so that it gets installed into the CICS region. Alternatively, you can use a DFHCSDUP script to update an existing CSD. This function is provided by the csd module.





Parameters
----------


     
job_id
  Identifies the job ID belonging to the running CICS region.

  The stop\_region module uses this job ID to identify the state of the CICS region and shut it down.


  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str


     
mode
  Specify the type of shutdown to be executed on the CICS region.


  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str
  | **default**: normal
  | **choices**: normal, immediate, cancel


     
no_sdtran
  No shutdown assist transaction is to be run at CICS shutdown.


  | **required**: False
  | **type**: bool


     
sdtran
  The 4-character identifier of the shutdown assist transaction.

  The default shutdown transaction, if neither SDTRAN nor NOSDTRAN is specified, is CESD.


  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str
